# Omics_ADRD_Integrated_Modeling
This project combines multi-omics biological aging clocks, polygenic risk scores (PRS), and advanced machine learning techniques to predict Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) using UK Biobank data. It includes R and Python code for data preprocessing, model construction, survival and competing risk analysis, and visualization.
